# The Fashion Capital
* This project was developed during [Flipkart's Grid 2.0 Hackathon](https://unstop.com/hackathons/flipkart-grid-20-software-development-challenge-flipkart-grid-20-flipkart-113664).
* Our team **Trinity** ([Chinmay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmaysharmacs10/), [Sarthak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarthak-m-d/), [Nachiket](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nachiket-agni-08687050/)) was **among the top 10** teams out of 400 participating teams.
* The Fashion Capital is a website that displays ongoing and upcoming T-shirt fashion trends to retailers so that they could efficiently build their stock for the coming weeks.
* We sourced data by scraping product information (title, image, rating values and the date of ratings) from e-commerce platforms using Scrapy.
* Created a k-means clustering model that categorized products as trending or non-trending using ratings-based features. Finally, we wrapped the model in a Flask API.
